# Tobacco-Use-and-Mortality
Tobacco Use and Mortality - Dashboard

This project analyzes the health and economic impacts of tobacco use in England from 2004–2014 using multiple datasets covering hospital admissions, fatalities, smoking demographics, prescription trends, and tobacco affordability.

Tech Stack - 

-> Power BI – Built an interactive dashboard integrating multiple datasets with custom navigation, slicers, dynamic KPIs, and diverse visualizations.

-> Microsoft Excel – Performed initial inspection, cleaning, date restructuring, and removal of aggregate rows from raw datasets.

-> DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures, top N filters, and year-over-year metrics responsive to user filters.

-> Python (Google Colab) – Preprocessed datasets with median imputation, merged files, and validated data before Power BI import.

Data Source - Kaggle

Problem -

Tobacco-related illnesses contribute significantly to hospital admissions, fatalities, and economic burden. Policymakers require a comprehensive, interactive tool to monitor trends, identify high-risk groups, and assess the impact of control measures.

Goal -

To integrate epidemiological and economic data into a single interactive platform, enabling tracking of admissions, fatalities, mortality rates, disease patterns, smoker demographics, and tobacco price trends for informed decision-making.

Insights - 

-> Admissions increased over time while fatalities remained stable, indicating possible treatment improvements.

-> Tobacco-attributable fatalities declined post-2008, suggesting better patient survival rates.

-> Tobacco affordability dropped sharply after the 1990s, yet spending remained substantial, showing persistent consumption.

-> Nicotine replacement prescriptions have declined since 2005, while initial uptake of Varenicline was followed by a drop after 2010.
